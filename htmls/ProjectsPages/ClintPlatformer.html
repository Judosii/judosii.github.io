        <p class="basic-text">A main project of mine that's been on hold since I started at my university, Rubika. You know, when you start a project, but have to focus on studies, so you come back a year later having forgotten all you've done? yeah that. So it's not coming out anytime soon. </p>
        <p class ="basic-text">So this page will also help me remember what to do and what I've done :)</p>
        <p class ="basic-text">Anyways I'm planning on making a fast-paced, hack & slash game, based on <b>Clint</b>, a kobold mercenary from a tabletop RPG campaign I played!</p>
        <p class ="basic-text">Since he's a kobold, I plan on leaning into nervous movements, wall jumping, dashing, and platforming will be just as prominent as fighting!</p>
        <p class ="basic-text">With Silksong having come out not too long ago (less than a week as I'm writing), I'm definitely gonna be inspired by it, movement wise. I forgot how good vaulting over ledges is, and the dash there feels great thanks to the freedom of movement, so I definitely gotta look into that!</p>
        <p class ="basic-text">Anyway, first I'll probably make some cool Godot Systems before starting prod on it during my free time. getting a robust state machine going with signals is on my todo list!</p>
