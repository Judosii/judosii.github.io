        <p class="basic-text">This is <b>Unlog</b>, a game made as a university project at Rubika, and it's available on steam! </p>
        <p class="basic-text">A short platformer, where you run, jump and dash through platforms and obstacles alike, trying to explore and escape the dream factory!</p>
        <p class="basic-text"><br>For this project, we haven't really focused on the story, mostly just on the gameplay, trying to make it feel great.</p>
        <p class="basic-text">While the other game designers were working on the player controller, and the level design, I myself, have worked on the level elements!</p>
        <p class="basic-text">Be it movable platforms, checkpoints, spikes, background parallax, you name it, I did it!</p>
        <p class="basic-text">However, coding the final boss proved challenging, and as a result, it is a challenge to defeat.</p>
        <p class="basic-text"><br> This game is free to play, and as previously said, it is on steam! if you want to see the work we put in,</p> <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3570210/Unlog"> why not try it for yourself?</a>
