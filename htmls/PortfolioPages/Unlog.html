<p class="basic-text">While the other game designers were working on the player controller, and the level design, I myself, have worked on the <b>level elements</b>!</p>
<p class="basic-text">Be it movable platforms, checkpoints, spikes, background parallax, <b>you name it, I did it</b>!</p>
<p class="basic-text">However, coding the final boss proved challenging, and as a result, it is a challenge to <b>defeat</b>.</p>
<p class="basic-text"><br>This game is <b>free to play</b>, and as previously said, it is on <b>steam</b>! if you want to see the work we put in,</p> <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3570210/Unlog"> why not try it for yourself?</a>
<p class="basic-text"><br>For those that want to know, this game was made in Unity in 2022, and the code was made in C#, using JetBrainsRider as a code editor!</p>
